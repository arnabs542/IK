package Tree;
/*
Tree Iterator



Problem Statement:



Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.



1. Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

2. Calling hasNext() should return whether the next element exists.



Both functions should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.



[Iterator is a concept in higher level languages like C++ or Java. You probably can tell what it is. If you want to know more, please feel free to Google for the concept.]



Input format:



There is only one argument named root denoting the root of the input tree.



Output format:



There is nothing to return as a whole. What the given method will do is described below:

Constructor/initializer: Initialize the iterator.

next(): Returns an integer denoting the next node value.

hasNext(): Returns a boolean denoting the next nodes presence.





Constraints:

0 <= number of nodes <= 100000
1 <= values stored in the nodes <= 10^9


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



../../../../../Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-02-25%20at%203.3



Sample Output:



1 2 3
