Kth Smallest Element Of BST



Problem Statement:



Given a BST (binary search tree), of size N, containing integer elements, and an integer k, you have to find kth smallest element of given BST.



Input/Output Format For The Function:



Input Format:



There are two arguments in the input. First one is the root of the BST and second one is an integer k.



Output Format:



Return an integer kmin, denoting kth smallest element of BST.



Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:



Input Format:



The first line of input should contain an integer N, denoting size of input array arr. In next N lines, ith line should contain an integer arr[i], denoting a value at index i of arr.

Input BST will be constructed by inserting elements of array arr to an empty BST in order arr[0], arr[1], â€¦, arr[N-1].



If n = 3, k = 3 and arr = [1, 2, 3], then input should be:



3

2

3

1

3



Output Format:



There will be one line of output, containing an integer kmin, denoting the result returned by solution function.



For input n = 3, k = 3 and arr = [1, 2, 3], output will be:



3



Constraints:

1 <= N <= 6000
1 <= k <= N
-2 * 10^9 <= value stored in any node <= 2 * 10^9
BST need not to be balanced.
You are not allowed to alter the structure or data inside the given BST.


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



BST =

2 is the root node.

1 is 2's left child.

3 is 2's right child.



k = 3



Sample Output:



3



Explanation:



3rd smallest element is 3.
