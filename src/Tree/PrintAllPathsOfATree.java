package Tree;
/*
Print All Paths of a Tree



Problem Statement:



Given a binary tree, print out all of its root-to-leaf paths one per line.

e.g. for a tree that's





Print:

1 2 4

1 2 5

1 3 6

1 3 7



Input format:



There is only one argument named root denoting the root of the input tree.



Output format:



Print the paths of the tree. You need not to worry about the order of paths in output, any valid answer will be accepted.



Constraints:



0 <= number of nodes <= 10000
1 <= values stored in the nodes <= 10^9


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:







Sample Output:



1 2 4

1 2 5

1 3



(Order of paths in output does not matter. Hence,



1 3

1 2 5

1 2 4



will also be considered as correct answer.)



Explanation:



There are 3 paths in the tree.

The left most path contains values: 1 -> 2 -> 4

The right most path contains values: 1 -> 3

The other path contains values: 1 -> 2 -> 5
