Largest BST



Problem Statement:



Given a binary tree, find the largest Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means BST with largest number of nodes in it. The largest BST must include all of its descendants.



Input format:



There is only one argument named root denoting the root of the input tree.



Output format:



Return an integer denoting the size of the largest BST



Constraints:



0 <= number of nodes <= 100000
1 <= values stored in the nodes <= 10^9


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



../../../../../Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-02-17%20at%2011.3



Sample Output:



3



Explanation:



In the input tree, left subtree of node 1 is a BST. It has 3 nodes and this is the largest BST. So, result is 3.
