package Tree;
/*
Clone a Binary Tree



Problem Statement:



Given a binary tree (represented by its root node, like usual), clone it. Return the root node of the cloned tree.



Remember: Cloning or copying a tree is best done recursively. Notice how clean and succinct the code is. Some of you may be tempted to do it breadth-first. But that's more complicated to handle in implementation.



Input format:



There is only one argument named root denoting the root of the input tree.



Output format:



Return the root of cloned tree



Constraints:



0 <= number of nodes <= 100000
1 <= values stored in the nodes <= 10^9


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:

Sample Output:



../../../../../Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-02-11%20at%2010.4
