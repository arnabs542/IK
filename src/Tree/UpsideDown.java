Upside Down



Problem Statement:



Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are leaf nodes, flip it upside down and turn it into a binary tree with left leaf nodes.



Keep in mind: ALL RIGHT NODES IN ORIGINAL TREE ARE LEAF NODE.



For example, turn these:



     1

    / \

   2 3

  / \

 4 5

/ \

6  7



 1

/ \

2  3



into these:



     1

    /

   2---3

  /

 4---5

 /

6---7





 1

/

2---3



where 6 is the new root node for the first tree, and 2 for the second tree.



oriented correctly:



 6

/ \

7   4

   / \

  5 2

       / \

      3 1





  2

 / \

3   1



Input format:



There is only one argument named root denoting the root of the input tree.



Output format:



You have to return the root of the flipped upside down tree.



Constraints:

0 <= number of nodes <= 100000
1 <= values stored in the nodes <= 100000
Every node either has 0 or 2 children.
Solution should use only constant extra space.
