Introduction
A Binary Search Tree is a special form of a binary tree. The value in each node must be greater than (or equal to) any values in its left subtree but less than (or equal to) any values in its right subtree.

We'll go through this definition more specifically in this chapter and provide you some exercise related to the binary search tree.

The goal of this card is to:

Understand the properties of a binary tree;
Be able to do basic operations in a binary search tree;
Understand the concept of a height-balanced binary search tree.
