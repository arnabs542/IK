Introduction
Google tech interviews are notoriously difficult and quite challenging. To get a phone screen, you will submit your resume to their online application system or via an internal referral from a Googler.

Assuming you passed their resume screen, a recruiter will reach out to you. Usually there will be two phone screens, and if you do well you'll be invited to onsite interviews.

Since Google operates at a large scale, be prepared to answer lots of follow up questions on how to scale the algorithm you wrote for multiple machines. Some examples are: Number of Islands, Intersection of Two Arrays II.
