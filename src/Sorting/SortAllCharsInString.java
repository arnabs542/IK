package Sorting;
/*
Sort an array of characters (ASCII only, not UTF8).



Input: A string of characters, like a full English sentence, delimited by a newline or NULL. Duplicates are okay.

Output: A string of characters, in sorted order of their ASCII values. You can overwrite the existing array.



Solution Complexity: Aim for linear time and constant additional space.



(What to understand from this problem: ASCII is great, because it's limited to 256. Remember that for any input that is bound to a range)



Solution: This is a trivial problem :-)
